    <h3>My time: <strong>{{cur_time}}</strong></h3>
    <p>My name is Yahir and I'm a 22 year old college student going into my last
        semester of (as of 12/22/2025) Computer Science and Cognitive Studies.
       Some stuff I am interested in include anything about philosophy, psychology, 
       neuroscience, and computers. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>What made you major in CS and Cog?</strong></p>
    <p>The main reason that I majored in CS and then Cog was due to the fact that my 
        university does not have a neuroscience major. So I just chose the next sciency thing that seemed 
        interesting. Even though I am in CS, Neuroscience is the field I have been wanting to 
        get into since I was 16. Now 6 years later, I am still not officially studying neuroscience but 
        I'm still not giving up. After I graduate, I will see what options I have to continue my education 
        in either CS or neuroscience or maybe both.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What are you currently studying?</strong></p>
    <p>I am currently studying for Comptia A+ and web development with Python.
        I plan on studying for at least the Network+, Security+, CySa+, and Linux+
        throughout the next 6 - 12 months. I do want to make the move towards cybersecurity 
        since that seems a lot more fun to do for a job than programming. I do enjoy programming
        but mainly for myself so I will just continue to learn things I want to rather than following 
        some roadmap to get a job. I am also going into my last semester of college. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>What are your long term goals?</strong></p>
